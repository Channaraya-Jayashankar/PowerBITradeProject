# 🛢️ EU Gas Storage & LNG Trade Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes **European Union gas storage** levels and **LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) imports** for the year 2024. The dashboard was built using **live data from the GIE API**, showcasing real-world energy insights through interactive visuals, KPIs, and trend analysis.

The project was completed as part of a technical interview task for a Junior Data Analyst role at **James Fisher & Sons**, simulating energy sector reporting and decision-support dashboards.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Extract and transform time-series energy data using the **GIE API**
- Visualize seasonal trends in **EU gas storage levels**
- Analyze **LNG import volumes by country, date, and vessel type**
- Discover **correlations between imports and storage behavior**
- Build a dynamic, business-ready dashboard using **Power BI and DAX**

---

## 📌 Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI** (Data model, DAX, Power Query M)
- **GIE API** (RESTful integration for gas storage data)
- **DAX** for measures, KPIs, and rolling trends
- **Data Modeling** (relationships, calculated columns)
- **SQL/Python** (supporting prep in prior phases)

## 📁 Pages in the Dashboard

### 1. 📅 **Gas Storage Seasonality**
- Line chart of gas in storage and full % by month
- Highlights storage build-up (spring/summer) and withdrawal (winter)
- KPIs: current storage level, YoY change, peak dates

### 2. 🚢 **LNG Trade Overview**
- LNG import volume by origin country
- Cargo arrival breakdown by vessel type and date
- KPIs: total imports, top countries, most common vessel type

### 3. 🔄 **Storage & LNG Correlation**
- Correlation between LNG volumes and injection/withdrawal trends
- Includes a bonus analysis: LNG volume vs. monthly % change in storage
- Scatter plot and dual-axis trendlines with tooltips

## 🔗 Data Sources

- **GIE API** – [Gas Infrastructure Europe API](https://agsi.gie.eu/#/)
- **LNG Shipment Extract (CSV)** – Provided as part of technical task

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Winter 2024** showed early storage depletion, indicating higher consumption
- **Spain and France** led LNG imports, with Medium Gas Carriers being dominant
- **High LNG volumes** directly aligned with **strong injection periods**
- **Storage % change** offered a unique way to measure import effectiveness

---

## ✅ Outcome

This project demonstrated how energy infrastructure data can be transformed into **actionable insights** for forecasting and operational planning — relevant for sectors such as **marine logistics, oil & gas, and energy finance**.
